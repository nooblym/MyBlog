# 时态练习题

1. "I _____ his telephone number." "I have his number, but I ____ to bring my phone book."

   A. forget, forget B. forgot, forgot

   C. forget, forgot D. forgot, forget

   【陷阱】容易误选 A，认为 "忘记" 是现在的事。

   【分析】仔细体会一下对话的语境：第一个人说 "我忘记他的电话号码了"，这个 "忘记" 应该是现在的情况，即现在忘记了，要不然就没有必要同对方说此话了，故第一空应填 forget；第二个人说 "我有他的号码，但我忘记带电话本了"，这个 "忘记" 应该是过去的情况，即过去忘记带电话本，所以现在电话本不在身上（注意句中的转折连词 but），故第二空应填 forgot，即答案选应 C. 请再看一例：

   　　- Oh, I ______ where he lives.

   　　- Don't you carry your address book?

   　　No, I ______ to bring it.

   　　A. forget, forget B. forgot, forgot

   　　C. forget, forgot D. forgot, forget

   　　答案选 C，理由同上。

2. I had hoped to see her off at the station, but I _____ too busy.

   A. was 				B. had been

   C. would be 	   D. would have been

   【陷阱】容易误选 B 或 D，认为前句用了 had hoped，所以此句谓语要用 B 或 D 与之呼应。

   【分析】但正确答案为 A，前一句谓语用 had hoped，表示的是过去未曾实现的想法或打算，可以译为 "本想"，而后一句说 "我太忙"，这是陈述过去的一个事实，所以要用一般过去时。请做以下类似试题（答案均为 A）：

   （1） We had hoped to catch the 10：20 train, but _____ it was gone.

   ​			A. found B. had found

   ​			C. would find D. would have found

   （2） We had hoped that you would be able to visit us, but you _____.

   ​			A. didn't B. hadn't

   ​			C. needn't D. would not have

   （3） We had wanted to come to see him, but we ____ no time.

   ​			A. had B. had had

   ​			C. would have D. would have had

   （4） I had expected to come over to see you last night, but someone ______ and I couldn't get away.

   ​			A. called B. had called

   ​			C. would call D. would have called

   （5） The traffic accident wouldn't have happened yesterday, but the driver _______ really careless.

   ​			A. was B. is

   ​			C. were D. had been

3. Dear me! Just _____ at the time! I _____ no idea it was so late.

   A. look, have B. looking, had

   C. look, had D. looking, have

   【陷阱】此题容易误选 D，认为第一空用现在分词表伴随，第二空填 have 的一般现在时，以保持与前面时态的一致性。

   【分析】其实，此题应选 C，第一空应填 look, 因为这是祈使句的谓语；第二空应填 had，因为前一句说 "看看时间吧"，这一看当然知道了现在很迟的情形，"不知道这么迟了" 显然应是 "过去" 的事，故应用一般过去时态，许多同学由于忽略这一隐含的语境而误选。

4. "Your phone number again? I _____ quite catch it." "It's 4331577."

   A. didn't B. couldn't

   C. don't D. can't

   【陷阱】此题容易误选 C，认为此处要用一般现在时态，表示现在 "没听清对方的话"。

   【分析】其实，此题答案应选 A，根据上文的语境 "请把你的电话号码再说一遍好吗？" 可知 "没听清对方的电话号码" 应是在说此话以前，故应用一般过去时态。请看以下类似试题：

   （1）"Mr Smith isn't coming tonight.""But he _____."

   ​			A. promises B. promised

   ​			C. will promise D. had promised

   答案选 B，"他答应（要来）" 应发生在过去。

   （2）"Hey, look where you are going!" "Oh, I'm terribly sorry. _____."

   ​			A. I'm not noticing B. I wasn't noticing

   ​			C. I haven't noticed D. I don't notice

   答案选 B，"我没注意" 是对方提醒之前的事，现经对方一提醒，当然注意到了。

   （3）"Oh it's you! I ________ you.""I've had my hair cut."

   ​			A. didn't realize B. haven't realized

   ​			C. didn't recognize D. don't recognized

   答案选 C."没认出是你" 是说此话之前的事，说此话时显然已经认出了对方。

   （4）"What's her new telephone number?""Oh, I _____."

   ​			A. forget B. forgot

   ​			C. had forgotten D. am forgetting

   此题应选 A，从语境上看，"忘记" 的时间应是现在，即指现在不记得了。

   （5）"Since you've agreed to go, why aren't you getting ready?" "But I ______ that you would have me start at once."

   ​		A. don't realize B. didn't realize

   ​		C. hadn't realized D. haven't realized

   答案选 B."没意识到" 是对方提醒之前的事。

   （6）"It's twelve o'clock, I think I must be off now." "Oh, really? I ______ it at all."

   ​			A. don't realize B. haven't realized

   ​			C. didn't realize D. hadn't realized

   答案选 C."没意识到" 是在听到的话之前的事。

5. Mr Smith ______ a book about China last year but I don't know whether he has finished it.

   A. has written B. wrote

   C. had written D. was writing

   【陷阱】容易误选 B 或 C.

   【分析】此题应选 D，这是由 but I don't know whether he has finished it 这一句话的语境决定的，全句意为" 史密斯先生去年在写一本书，但我不知道他现在是否写完了 "。有的同学可能由于受 last year 的影响而误选 B. 但若选 B，则句子前半部分的意思则变为" 史密斯先生去年写了一本书 "，既然是" 写了 "，那么这与下文的" 但我不知道他现在是否写完了 " 相矛盾。

6. He has changed a lot. He _______ not what he _______.

   A. is, is B. was, was

   C. is, was D. was, is

   【陷阱】几个干扰项均有可能误选。

   【分析】最佳答案选 C，上文说 "他" 变化很大，即 "他" 现在不是过去的那个样子了，故第一空填 is，第二空填 was（其实第二空也可用 used to be）。请看类例：

   "What place is it?" "Haven't you found out we _____ back where we ______?"

   ​		A. were, had been		 B. have been, are

   ​		C. are, were 					D. are, had been

   答案选 C，We are back where we were 的意思是 "我们（现在）又回到刚才来过的地方"。

7. He is very busy. I don't know if he _____ or not tomorrow.

   A. come B. comes

   C. will come D. is coming

   【陷阱】此题容易误选 B. 认为 if 引导的是条件状语从句，从句谓语要用一般现在时表示将来意义。

   【分析】其实，此题答案应选 C，句中 if 引导的不是条件状语从句（即 if≠如果），而是宾语从句（即 if＝是否），句意为 "他很忙，我不知道明天他是否会来。" 请看以下类似试题：

   （1）I don't know if she _____, but if she ____ I will let you know.

   ​			A. comes, comes B. will come, will come

   ​			C. comes, will come D. will come, comes

   答案选 D，第一个 if 引导的是宾语从句，第二个 if 引导的是条件状语从句。

   （2）"When _____ he come?" "I don't know, but when he _____, I'll tell you."

   ​			A. does, comes B. will, will come

   ​			C. does, will come D. will, comes

   答案选 D，第一个 when 疑问副词，用于引出一个特殊疑问句；第二个 when 是从属连词，用于引导时间状语从句。

   （3）"When he _____ is not known yet." "But when he ____, he will be warmly welcomed."

   ​			A. comes, comes B. will come, will come

   ​			C. comes, will come D. will come, comes

   ​	答案选 D，第一个 when 引导的是主语从句，第二个 when 引导的是时间状语从句。

8. The bridge, which _____ 1688, needs repairing.

   ​			A. is dated from B. was dated from

   ​			C. dates from D. dated from

   【陷阱】此题容易误选 B 或 D，认为句中用了 1688 这个过去时间，所以应选过去时态，又因为 date from 不用于被动语态，所以只能选 D.

   【分析】其实此题的最佳答案应是 C，因为 date from 的意思是 "自某时起存在至今"（＝have existed since），它通常用于一般现在时，而不用过去时态（尽管其后接的总是表示过去的时间）。如：

   The church dates from 1176. 这座教堂是六世纪建的。

   The castle dates from the 14th century. 这座城堡是 14 世纪建的。

   但若所谈论的东西现在已不复存在，则可用一般过去时。如：

   The church, which dated from the 13th century, was destroyed in an earthquake two years ago. 那座教堂是 13 世纪建成的，两年前在一次地震中被毁了。

   注：与 date from 同义的 date back to 也有类似用法。

9. "You've left the light on.""Oh, so I have. _____ and turn it off."

   A. I'll go B. I've gone

   C. I go D. I'm going

   【陷阱】容易误选 D.

   【分析】A 和 D 两者均可表示将来，填入空格处似乎都可以。但实际上只有 A 是最佳的，因为根据上下文的语境来看，"我去把灯关掉" 这一行为是说话人听了对方的话后临时想到的，而不是事先准备的。而按英语习惯：will 和 be going to 后接动词原形均可表示意图，但意图有强弱之分，如果是事先考虑过的意图，要用 be going to；如果不是事先考虑过的，而是说话时刻才临时想到的意图，则用 will. 比较：

   "I've come out without any money.""Never mind, I will lend you some."" 我出来没带钱。""没关系，我借给你。"（句中用 will lend，表示 "借" 钱给对方是临时想到的，即听了对方的话后临时作出的反应）

   I've bought a typewriter and I'm going to learn to type. 我买了台打字机，我想学打字。（句中用 be going to learn to type，表示说话人要学打字是事先准备的，并为此买了台打字机）
