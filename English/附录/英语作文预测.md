**热点预测 1：健康生活**
---------------

### 1. 网瘾

中国社会近些年一直提倡健康生活方式，但网瘾普遍存在于青少年之中，对其学习和生活都造成了很大不良影响！**往年高考并未考到这个话题**，今年备考可以在这个话题上准备一些！

**【题目要求】**

假设你是李华，你在美国夏令营认识的朋友 Mike 给你来信说他最近沉迷于电脑难以控制。请你给他回一封信，告诉他网瘾可能会导致成绩下降、健康状况恶化、损害家庭关系等问题，并提出一些建议。

参考词汇：沉溺于 be/become addicted to 网瘾：Internet addiction

**【优秀范文】**

Dear Jack,

I am glad to hear from you. As your close friend, I’d like to talk about the harm of Internet addiction to you as I feel worried to know that you have wasted lots of valuable time playing the Internet games.

As we know, the Internet is a convenient tool to improve our knowledge and skills. However, our life will be greatly affected if we are addicted to it. For example your grades may go down and your health will be going from bad to worse. To make things worse, it can also damage the relationship with your family. So I think it is high time that you got rid of the bad habit. It is a good idea for you to read some meaningful books and do some physical exercise.

I am looking forward to hearing your good news soon．

Yours,

Li Hua

### 2. 健康生活 — 拒为低头族

伴随着互联网日益深入人们的生活，**低头一族诞生并不断增加，**公交车、地铁等公共场合到处都是低头看手机者的身影，手机已经成为低头族身体的一部分。同时，这种生活方式对人们的身体健康造成极大的不良影响，应当引起相当重视。

**【题目要求】**

现在越来越多的人成为低头族（People who can’t help checking their phones all day are known as phubbers. Phubbing trends to involve not only the young people, but also the elderly.)，如何引导低头族抬头？你们班举行了以 “拒为低头族” 为主题的班会。假设你是学生李华，请为班会写一篇 100 词左右的发言稿。

要点如下：

1. 你周围有低头族吗？他们成为 “低头族” 的原因。

2. 成为 “低头族” 给学习和生活带来的影响。

3. 就如何 “拒为低头族” 提一些建议。

**【优秀范文】**

Nowadays, we can see many people are watching their mobile phones in subway, restaurants, elevators, roads and so on. There is no denying that people who like the mobile phone are concerned about its attractive functions. Phubbers can’t stop sending messages, surfing the Internet, listening to music and even taking photos by using the mobile phone. Moreover, some people have less time to relax themselves. They make use of the time when they are on the way to school or other places to play mobile games.

However, phubbing disturbs not only our study but also our life. On the one hand, phubbers waste lots of time playing cell phone games and sending messages, particularly in class. Other people also complain they are disturbed when phones ring in classrooms. On the other hand, it can lead to health problems. For instance, using a mobile phone on the sofa can cause back and neck pain.

As far as I am concerned, it is high time that we threw away the phone and raised our heads up. Do cherish everything around us and appreciate the scenery ahead of us. What’s more, we should do more exercises and take part in real-life activities. In a word, only when we use the phone reasonably, can we realize the happiness of life.

**热点预测 2：中国传统文化艺术**

### 1. 中华饮食：茶

近几年，高考英语写作多次出现对中国传统文化的考查，例如唐诗、剪纸等。因此，今年考查传统文化的的可能性依然很大，**而对于中国饮食还未见考查**，所以，在备考复习时，可以多在这个主题上下些功夫！

Dear Jack,

I'm glad to hear from you. And now I’m very happy to share something about Chinese tea culture in reply to your last e-mail.

Some Chinese believe that tea benefits people’s health a lot. Drinking a cup of tea makes people relaxed and refreshed. Others treat guests or friends to tea drinking in social communication.

Dear Peter,

The picture is about a Chinese idiom “wen ji qi wu”. This idiom originated from a well-known story happened in Xin Jin Dynasty. In order to serve their country well, two patriotic young men, named Zu Ti and Liu Kun, both got up and practised sword playing the moment they heard the cock crow. Day by day and year in, year out, they never stopped. Later, they all made great contributions to protecting their country.

Nowadays, people usually use the phrase “rising up upon hearing the crow of a rooster to practise sword playing” to signify that someone is exerting himself to do something worthwhile. It is also used to describe that a person of noble aspirations exerts himself in time.

If you have any other questions about this idiom, please tell me.

### **1. 关于高铁**

**【题目要求】**

高铁给人们的出行带来了快捷和方便，请你写一篇短文简单介绍武广高铁。

基本情况：  

1. 始建于 2005 年，2009 年 12 月 26 日开通运营，干线全长 1068 公里；  
2. 途经湖北、湖南和广东；

   主要优点：

5. 高铁列车设施齐全，安全舒适。  
   美中不足：  
6. 票价偏高；  
7. 车站离市中心较远。

**【优秀范文】**

First built in 2005, the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway went into operation on December,26th,2009. Overall length of its main line is 1068 kilometers, and it goes through the following three provinces: Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong.

The speed of the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway is 350km/h,the fastest speed in the world now, which makes it only three hours needed from Wuhan to Guangzhou, seven hours less than before. Besides, there are all kinds of facilities in the train, which make your trip safe and comfortable, so it is more humanitarian.

However, the only fly in the ointment is that the train fare is too high and the station is quite far away from the downtown area.

### **2. 移动支付**

**【题目要求】**

随着微信，支付宝、银行 APP 等的发展想必大家都爱用他们支付购买。那么，通过网络进行的货币支付或资金流转给我们的生活带来了哪些好处呢? 请你以移动支付的好处为主题写一篇英语短文。

**【优秀范文】**

The Advantages of Online Payment

Online payment has been advocated around the world, which is the future way to pay bills. In China, Alipay is popular everywhere, even the small business can be finished by this advanced way. People play the joke that they don’t need to worry about the lack of cash. The advantages of online payment are obvious.

Firstly, it saves people’s time to pay bills. The use of online payment is carried out with a smart phone. Especially when we go to the supermarket, there are always a lot of people waiting in the long line. The process of costing customers’ time is to take out the cash or use the credit card, because both customers and cashiers need to count the money or check the bills. But now the cashier can just scan the phone and the bill will be paid and the customer can check quickly.

Second, people don’t have to worry about getting the fake cash. Many years ago, people were easy to get fake money as they received the change. But now, as the cash have been used less, people won’t receive the fake cash without paper money. With the development of new applications, our life will be much convenient.

2. 开头和结尾已给出，不计入总词数。

提示词：智能手机 smartphone，二维码 the QR code

**【优秀范文】**

Dear Jim,

I’m writing to tell you more about the new form of sharing bike--mobike mentioned in your latest letter.

It’s very convenient to use if you have a smartphone. What you do is to find a nearest mobike through the APP, scan the QR code on the bike, and enjoy your trip.

Compared to other forms of sharing bike, the greatest advantage of mobike is that you can easily find one and never worry about where to park it. It is becoming a new trend as a means of transportation, which relieves the traffic pressure and does good to the environment as well.

Hope to ride a mobike with you in China.

Yours,

### **4. 网购**

**【优秀范文】**

With the development of the Internet and the popularization of computers, shopping on the Internet has become a commonplace in our life. Here consumers can buy almost everything they need.

Shopping on the Internet has a lot of advantages, of which the most important is perhaps its convenience. People don't have to waste a lot of their energy and precious time to go from one shop to another to choose the commodities they like. This is especially desirable to the old, the sick and the busy people who cannot go to the shops in person（亲自）. The goods come in all shapes, sizes and colors on the Internet. All they need to do is to sit in front of their computers and click the mouse（点击鼠标）. The commodities they order will be delivered（运送）to them promptly.

However, shopping on the Internet also has its disadvantages. The first disadvantage is that the consumers can't see the goods or try them on（试穿，试验） personally. Sometimes, the real goods may not be the same as what they have seen on the computer. The second disadvantage is that some shops on the Internet are not registered（注册）. They will never deliver anything to you after they get the money from you. Once cheated, you will find that you have nowhere to go to complain.

Dear Eli,

Having learned that you are interested in the trash-sorting program promoted recently in China, I am here writing to give you a brief introduction.

As far as I know, Shanghai has become the pioneer of our country's waste sorting policy. As of July 1st this year, the residents in Shanghai have not been able to dump their waste bags in whichever bin was closest. On the contrary, domestic waste is required to be classified into four categories: dry refuse, wet trash, recyclable waste and hazardous(dangerous) waste.

Faced with the new rule, many citizens in Shanghai are finding it a little too complicated, with every item of waste now under careful scrutiny(examination) and classification. Still, there are more people who warmly support the policy because it helps people to cultivate greener lifestyle habits and helps China to become a more beautiful country.

Yours,

#### 02. 新冠病毒来历

2019 年的冬天，一种新型冠状病毒 (the pneumonia epidemic) 在武汉华南海鲜市场滋生，悄然从野生动物传染给人类。据央视新闻客户端消息，截至 2020 年 1 月 29 日 24 时，我国已累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊病例 7711 例，死亡 170 例。

新型冠状病毒疫情在武汉早期确诊的病例，与武汉华南海鲜市场关系很密切。调查显示，此前在海鲜市场中有非法售卖野生动物现象。人类生存离不开野生动物，但现实生活中野生动物被捕食或作他用比比皆是。

Since the pneumonia epidemic broke out in Wuhan in December, the number of people infected and patients who have died keep climbing. It is reported that the epidemic has something to do with the killing and selling of wild animals at South China Seafood Market. With the decrease of wild animals, many animals are endangered. Worse still,some of them may disappear forever.

There is no doubt that hunting and killing wild animals has a bad influence. For wild animals are killed for their fur, which causes the imbalance of nature. For another, due to the contact between humans and wild animals, epidemics like SARS and pneumonia may infect humans easily.

As far as I am concerned, something must be done to stop this illegal action. First, Nature Reserves are supposed to be built so as to offer more living space to wildlife. Second, be aware that never have wild animals for food, as they are part of environment. Third, it is high time that we raised people’s awareness to protect wildlife. In this way, we can build a harmonious society and ensure a sustainable development.

I am Li Hua, a senior school student. I am extremely sorry to disturb you, but I have to write a letter to convey my complaint and dissatisfaction. The novel coronavirus epidemic is still tough and annoying. However, you can't imagine that a small number of businesses are so mean as to sell the face masks at an unreasonable price. It is said that it can be five times as high as the normal price. My classmates and I are burning with anger. I hope Consumers' Association can give much attention to this. I'd appreciate it if you can cope with it as early as you can.

Yours sincerely,
