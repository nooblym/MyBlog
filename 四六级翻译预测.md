At present, China is the world's largest producer of rice, producing 26% of the world rice output.

The rice crop in China grows primarily in provinces along the Yangtze River and in the South.

4. **垃圾分类**

> 随着人民生活水平和消费水平的提高，中国的垃圾问题日益严峻。很多城市被垃圾包围。面对日益增长的垃圾产量和环境状况的恶化。中国政府正在努力推行垃极分类(garbage classification)的政策。垃圾分类是指将垃圾分为可回收利用和不可回收利用两类，要求人们将垃圾投放至不同的垃圾桶(trash can)，通过不同的清理、运输和回收方式，使之变成新的资源。它可以减少垃圾处理量，降低处理成本，减少土地资源的消耗，对社会、经济、生态三方面都有益。

With the improvement of people's living standards and the increase of consumption level,the garbage problem in China becomes increasingly urgent. Many cities are surrounded by garbage. Confronted with the growing garbage output and deteriorating environment, the Chinese government is implementing the policy of garbage classification with great effort. Garbage classification means dividing garbage into recyclable and unrecyclable,and requires people to put garbage into different trash cans so that it can become new resources through different ways of cleaning,transporting and recycling. It can reduce not only the amount of garbage that needs to be disposed,but also the deposing cost and the usage of land,benefiting our society,economy and environment.
